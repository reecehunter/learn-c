# Learn C
This repository is designed to guide you through a series of small tasks to teach you C step by step. I know this repository will help you because this is essentially my notes from teaching myself C.

# Recommended usage
1. Start with 01_hello_world.
2. Read the README.md file and attempt the task.
3. When finished, compare your code to mine.

# Disclaimer
I am making this repository while I learn C. You might create code that is "better" and/or more correct than mine. If that's the case, feel free to make a pull request, or let me know.
